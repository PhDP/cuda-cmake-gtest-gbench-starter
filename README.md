# CUDA/C++17 cmake starter with google test and google benchmark
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A cross-platform CUDA/C++17 starter project with google test (1.12.1) and
google benchmark (v1.7.1) support. [See this
project](https://github.com/PhDP/cmake-gtest-gbench-starter) for a similar
template without CUDA support.

# Build

On Linux/Unix, to build and make the test:

    $ mkdir build && cd $_
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

CUDA is strict about compiler version, on UNIX, cmake will honor the CXX
variable, so for example to use gcc 11 you can write (before calling cmake):

    $ export CC=gcc-11
    $ export CXX=g++-11

or

    $ CC=gcc-11 CXX=g++-11 cmake ..

By default, the makefiles will build the library, executable, tests, and
benchmarks. The commands

    $ ./test/test_deepgreen
    $ ./bench/bench_deepgreen

...will run the tests and benchmarks.

On Windows, you can use cmake to generate Visual Studio build files with the
same 'cmake ..' command.

See the CMakeLists.txt file to see all the options.
